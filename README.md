# code-style-checker
This is my final project for the introductory programming and problem solving module at university.

## What This Repository Contains

### Design
- Code Style Checker ERD.png - the entity relationship diagram for the minimum viable product to design the layout of the program.
- Code Style Checker Interface.png - the original interface design for the application, which of course is subject to change.

### Program
#### Validators
All the validators that the program uses. These include:  
- \_\_pycache__ - contains Python 3 code that has been compiled and is ready to be executed.
- EqualsSpaceMissingValidator.py - checks to see if there are any missing spaces before or after an equals sign.
- NumberOfClassesValidator.py - checks how many classes there are in a JavaScript. There should be a maximum of 1.
- ValidatorRunner.py - runs the validators in this folder.
- VarUseValidator.py - checks to see if there are any occurrences of `var` in the code. `let` or `const` should be used instead.
- \_\_init__.py - treats the project as a package, so classes can be imported despite the file structure.

### Python.gitignore
The files for Git to ignore when pushing to the remote repository.
